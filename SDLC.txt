3. What is SDLC? Explain each phase of SDLC
answer:-

SDLC (software development life cycle):- is a big-picture breakdown of all the steps involved in software creation (planning, coding, testing, deploying, etc.). Companies define custom SDLCs to create a predictable, iterative framework that guides the team through all major stages of development.


Phase of SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)
>> PHASE 1
Requirements Analysis

~ Purpose: Create an overview of the project, determine requirements, and set the product groundwork
~ Key personnel: Business analysts
~ Output: An SRS document that defines project goals and needs


>> PHASE 2
Feasibility Study

~ Purpose: Evaluate whether the requirements analysis aligns with business goals and resources 
~ Key personnel: Team leads and higher management
~ Output: An expanded SRS document approved by a decision-maker


>> PHASE 3
Design Plan

~ Purpose:  Design the upcoming product (architecture, Ul, features, security measures, etc.) 
~ Key personnel: Architects and senior developers
~ Output: A detailed DDS document that explains how to code the product


>> PHASE 4
Software Development

~ Purpose: Translate the system design into source code and build the first version of the product 
~ Key personnel: Developers
~ Output: Testable, fully functional software


>> PHASE 5
In-Depth Software Testing

~ Purpose: Ensure the product has no bugs or exploits and that it is in line with DDS expectations 
~ Key personnel: All levels of testers
~ Output: A thoroughly tested version of the product


>> PHASE 6
Software Deployment

~ Purpose: Push the new product into production by gradually phasing it into use 
~ Key personnel: Deployment engineers 
~ Output: The release of a fully functional and tested product


>> PHASE 7
Maintenance and Enhancement

~ Purpose: Keep the product safe and at optimal performance, plus occasionally add new features
~ Key personnel: Production support engineers, testers, and developers 
~ Output: A fully monitored product that's continuously seeing improvements
